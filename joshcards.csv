"Explain Quality of Service (QoS) and its importance in networking.","Quality of Service (QoS) ensures that certain network traffic receives priority over other traffic to meet performance requirements. It helps prioritize critical data, such as voice and video, to maintain a consistent user experience and avoid issues like latency and jitter. QoS is vital for networks with different types of traffic, such as real-time applications and file transfers."
"How does a router make forwarding decisions in a network?","Routers use routing tables to make forwarding decisions. When a router receives a data packet, it checks the destination IP address against the routing table to determine the best path to send the packet to its destination. The router forwards the packet accordingly to the next hop along the route."
"What are some common network troubleshooting tools and their uses?","Common network troubleshooting tools include: Ping (tests connectivity between devices), Traceroute (shows the path and latency of data packets between source and destination), ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Linux) (displays network configuration details), nslookup (queries DNS servers for domain name resolution), Wireshark (captures and analyzes network traffic), and Netstat (shows active network connections and statistics)."
"How can you identify and resolve network congestion issues?","Network congestion can be identified by monitoring network traffic and analyzing performance metrics. To resolve congestion, you can implement QoS policies, increase network bandwidth, optimize routing, or prioritize critical traffic. Proper network capacity planning can also help prevent congestion issues."
"Explain the process of port forwarding in network routing.","Port forwarding allows external devices to access services hosted on a local network. It involves configuring a router to forward specific ports to a designated internal IP address. This way, incoming traffic targeting the specific port will be redirected to the specified device on the local network. Port forwarding is commonly used for hosting web servers, gaming, and remote access applications."
"How can network monitoring tools help in maintaining network performance?","Network monitoring tools continuously collect data on network performance, usage, and potential issues.
